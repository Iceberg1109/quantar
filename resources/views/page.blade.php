            <p>Welcome to the Quantar privacy policy ("Privacy Policy"). This Privacy Policy is complementary to, and should be read and understood
                together with our general Terms of Use, and all defined
                terms in the Terms of Use, shall apply to this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. All information, including your personal information

                <li> -	Internet connection, hardware used to access the website and usage details </li>

            </ul>

            <h4>Information You Provide To Us</h4>

                event that you contact us your responses to surveys completed, from time to time; your activity history on the Website; and/or User Content.</p>

            <p>Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you therefore directly control what information you share.
                Any information that you voluntarily choose to include on the Website that is accessible to other users, such as a public profile page,
                or in a forum posting, will be available to other users who access that content. This also applies to information you choose to make
                available through features that link to third party services. Once you make your information available to others on the Website, your
                information could be collected and used by the users without restriction. We urge users to use common sense and good judgement when
                sharing information publicly on the Website.</p>

            <h4>Data Collection Technologies</h4>
            <p>The Website may use automatic data collection, depending on the features offered. This may include visits to the Website and how users use the features. This helps customise the Website for visitors in order to improve it, by allowing us
                to estimate usage patterns and store information about user preferences in order to meet the needs of users.</p>

            <p>Automatically collected information is statistical data and does not include Personal Information, however, we may maintain it or associate it with Personal
                Information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties.</p>

            <p>The technologies we use for automatic data collection may include browser cookies. A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser, while the user is browsing. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser, however, if you select this setting it may influence the functionality of certain parts of the
                Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting to block cookies, our system will use cookies when you use the Website.</p>

            </ul>

            <h4>Disclosure Of Your Information</h4>

            <p>We may disclose combined information about our users that is not personally identifiable, without limitation.</p>
            <p>We are not in the business of selling your information. We may, however, disclose your Personal Information in order to develop and maintain
                the Website and to operate Competitions. We share your personal information in the following cases:</p>

            <h5>With your consent</h5>
            <p>We will only share your Personal Information outside the Website if we have your consent. For example,
                in the event that you give us permission to provide your information to a prospective employer.</p>

            <h5>For Competitions</h5>
            <p>We may disclose your Personal Information to the hosts of Competitions to enable your participation in the Competition.
                The details of such disclosure may be more fully detailed in the relevant Competition Rules.</p>

            <h5>For external processing purposes</h5>
            <p>We may provide personal information to our subsidiaries, affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, in compliance with this Privacy
                Policy and keeping in mind appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>

            <h5>For legal reasons</h5>
            <p>We will share personal information outside of the Website if we believe that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: ensure
                compliance with any court order, law or legal process; enforce our Terms of Use; detect and prevent fraud, abuse and security issues or concerns;
                and/or safeguard against harm to the rights or safety of Zindi, or our affiliates, users, or the public (and as required or permitted by law).</p>

            <h4>Accessing Your Information</h4>
            <p>You can review and change your information on the account settings page of the Website.</p>

            <p>If you delete your account from the Website, copies of the information you have previously provided may remain viewable in cached and archived pages.</p>
            <p>Business and legal requirements require us to retain certain information for an extended period of time. For example, when you submit an entry in a Competition, we may keep certain
                information related to your entry in order to guard against cheating, or for legal purposes. Other reasons we might retain some data include: security reasons, fraud and abuse prevention; financial record-keeping; and/or in order to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.</p>

                You are responsible for keeping your password private in order to prevent unauthorised access to your account.</p>
            <p>Despite what has been stated above, the internet is not a secure medium and privacy cannot be ensured. Zindi will not be responsible for any damages that you or any third party may suffer as a result of any unauthorised interception of the Website. Furthermore,
                we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.</p>

            <h4>Changes To Our Privacy Policy</h4>
